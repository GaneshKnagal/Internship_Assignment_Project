    "Answer: There are several ways to handle missing data. One of the most common ways is to use imputation techniques.\n",
    " Imputation techniques are methods used to fill in missing data points with estimated values based on other available information.\n",
    " Some of the commonly used imputation techniques are mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation,\n",

    "# 15. What are the various branches of statistics?\n",
    "Answer: Statistics is a broad field that encompasses many different branches. Some of the main branches of statistics include descriptive   statistics,  inferential statistics, probability theory, statistical modeling, and statistical learning. Descriptive statistics    involves summarizing and  describing data using measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation. Inferential statistics involves making inferences about a population based on a sample of data. Probability theory is the study of random events and their probabilities.  Statistical modeling involves developing models to describe relationships between variables. \n",
    "Statistical learning involves developing algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data."
