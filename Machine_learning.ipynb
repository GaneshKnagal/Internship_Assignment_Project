    "Answer: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in a model. \n",
    " It adds a penalty term to the cost function that shrinks the parameter estimates towards zero.\n",
    " This technique is used when the model is too complex and has too many features. \n",
    " Regularization helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve its generalization performance."

    "# Question 14:Which particular algorithms are used for regularization? \n",
    "Answer: There are many different regularization algorithms that can be used in machine learning.\n",
    "  The best regularization algorithm to use will depend on the specific machine learning problem that is being solved.\n",
    "  Elastic net regularization is a combination of ridge regression and lasso regression.\n",
    "  It adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to a linear combination of the square of the magnitude of the coefficients   and the absolute value of the coefficients.This can be helpful for models that have both high-cardinality features and features with     strong correlations.\n"
